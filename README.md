# Goonhilly-Arthur-Satellite-Dish-in-Minecraft
Build the famous satellite dish on the Cornish Lizard in Minecraft.

This exercise was worked up for a Tech Jam that was part of a TechConnect held at Goonhilly in 2018.

The pdf is the instructions for the workshop. It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi at a Software Cornwall Tech Jam.
All the software needed is as Raspbian standard except for the arthur_blocks.py mentioned below. No previous experience with
Minecraft and Python is really necessary but a little help from someone who has done a bit might be better.


These instructions utilise some code to build the base directly within Minecraft. The code is simpler than the Cornish Engine House
as most of the block id are part of the separate file.
Onto the base an index of all the blocks is used to build the actual dish.
The arthur_blocks.py file will need to be in the same folder as the code being created for it to work.
