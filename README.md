The pdf is the instructions for the workshop. It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi at a Software Cornwall Tech Jam.
All the software needed is as Raspbian standard except for the arthur_blocks.py mentioned below.


These instructions utilise some code to build the base directly within Minecraft. 
Onto this base an index of all the blocks is used to build the actual dish.
The arthur_blocks.py file will need to be in the same folder as the code being created for it to work.
